            <TD>Helium is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions due to its valence of zero. It is an electrical insulator unless
               ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical
               discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable <a class="glink" href="gcompound.htm">compounds</a> with <a class="elink" href="74.htm">tungsten</a>, <a class="elink" href="53.htm">iodine</a>, <a class="elink" href="9.htm">fluorine</a>, <a class="elink" href="16.htm">sulfur</a> and <a class="elink" href="15.htm">phosphorus</a> when it is subjected to an electric glow discharge, through <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> bombardment or is otherwise a plasma. HeNe, HgHe<sub>10</sub>, WHe<sub>2</sub> and the molecular ions He<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, He<sub>2</sub><sup>++</sup>, HeH<sup>+</sup>, and HeD<sup>+</sup> have been created this way. This technique has also allowed the production of the neutral molecule He<sup>2</sup>, which has a large number of band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently only held together by polarization forces. Theoretically,
               other compounds, like helium fluorohydride (HHeF), may also be possible.
