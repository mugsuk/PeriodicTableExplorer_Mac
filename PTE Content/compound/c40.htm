               crystalline structure, is the rare mineral, baddeleyite. The high temperature cubic crystalline form, called 'cubic zirconia',
               is rarely, if ever, found in nature, but is synthesized in various colours for use as a gemstone and is the best-known diamond
               simulant.

Stabilized zirconia is used in <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a> sensors and fuel cell membranes because it has a unique ability to allow oxygen ions to move freely through the crystal structure
               at high temperatures. This high ionic conductivity (and a low electronic conductivity) makes it one of the most useful electroceramics.

            <TD>Zirconia is one of few compounds that actually becomes conductive at high temperatures, and more conductive, as its temperature
               increases. Zirconia starts out with a very high resistance at room temperature, greater than 1 trillion ohm-cm. As the temperature
               increases it has less than 20,000 ohm-cm at 500 degrees Celsius, to having less than 1,000 ohm-cm of resistance at 1,000 degrees
               Celsius. It loses nearly all of its resistance around 2,000 degrees Celsius, and becomes a very good conductor.
