            <TD>Hydrochloric acid is a fundamental chemical, and as such it is used for a large number of small-scale applications, such as
               leather processing, household cleaning, and building construction. In addition, a way of stimulating oil production is by
               injecting hydrochloric <a class="glink" href="gacid.htm">acid</a> into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil-well acidizing
               is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.
