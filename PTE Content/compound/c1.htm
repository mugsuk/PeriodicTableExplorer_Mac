            <TD>Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogens</a> (e.g., <a class="elink" href="9.htm">F</a>, <a class="elink" href="17.htm">Cl</a>, <a class="elink" href="35.htm">Br</a>, <a class="elink" href="53.htm">I</a>) and chalcogens (<a class="elink" href="8.htm">O</a>, <a class="elink" href="16.htm">S</a>, <a class="elink" href="34.htm">Se</a>); in these compounds <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to <a class="elink" href="9.htm">fluorine</a>, <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a>, or <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a>, <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> can participate in a form of strong noncovalent bonding called hydrogen bonding, which is critical to the stability of many
               biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as the metals and metalloids,
               in which it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.
