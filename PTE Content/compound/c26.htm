            <TD>The iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red cells of the blood in mammals and other animals. Hemoglobin
               in vertebrates transports oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, such as to the muscles, where it releases the oxygen
               load. Hemoglobin also has a variety of other gas-transport and effect-modulation duties, which vary from species to species,
               and which in invertebrates may be quite diverse.
