               glass fibres to a polymer matrix, stabilizing the composite material. They can also be used to couple a bio-inert layer on
               a <a class="elink" href="22.htm">titanium</a> implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonary protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline
