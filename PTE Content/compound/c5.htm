               advertised uses was as a hand-cleaner for industrial workers. It is used in making enamel glazes, glass and strengthening
               pottery and ceramics. It is also easily converted to boric <a class="glink" href="gacid.htm">acid</a> or borate, which have many applications. It is also used to make buffer solutions that are used in chemical analysis.
