            <TD>The first chemical compound of xenon, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, was synthesized in 1962. Now, many compounds of xenon are
               known, including xenon difluoride, xenon tetrafluoride, xenon hexafluoride, xenon tetroxide, xenon hydrate, xenon deuterate,
               and sodium perxenate. A highly explosive compound xenon trioxide has also been made.

            <TD>Recently at the University of Helsinki in Finland, a group of scientists prepared HXeH, HXeOH, and HXeCCH (xenon dihydride,
               xenon hydride-hydroxide, and hydroxenoacetylene). They are stable up to 40K.
