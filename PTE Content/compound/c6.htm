            <TD>Carbon is abundant in the sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic
               diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. In combination with other elements, carbon
               is found in the earth's atmosphere (around 810 gigatonnes) and dissolved in all water bodies (around 36000 gigatonnes). Around
               1900 gigatonnes are present in the biosphere. Hydrocarbons (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas) contain carbon as well--coal
               "reserves" (not "resources") amount to around 1000 gigatonnes, and oil reserves around 150 gigatonnes. With smaller amounts
               of calcium, magnesium, and iron, carbon is a major component of very large masses carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite, marble
               etc.).

            <TD>Carbon monoxide, though thought of as a pollutant today, has always been present in the atmosphere, chiefly as a product of
               volcanic activity. It occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the earth's mantle. Carbon monoxide contents
               of volcanic gases vary from less than 0.01% to as much as 2% depending on the volcano.
