               of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water, but so far they have all been either mistaken
               or crooks. Reverend Prescott Jernegan ran a gold-from-seawater swindle in America in the 1890s. A British fraud ran the same
               scam in England in the early 1900s.
