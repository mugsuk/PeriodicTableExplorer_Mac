            <td class="JF">A pyrophoric substance is a substance that ignites spontaneously, that is, its autoignition <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> is below room <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>. Examples are <a class="elink" href="26.htm">iron</a> sulfide (FeS) and many reactive metals including <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a>, when powdered or sliced thin. Pyrophoric materials are often water reactive as well and will ignite when they contact water
               or humid air. They can be handled safely in atmospheres of <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a> or <a class="elink" href="18.htm">argon</a>. Most pyrophoric fires should be extinguished with a class D fire extinguisher.

            <td class="JF">The creation of sparks from metals is based on the pyrophoricity of small metal particles. This can be useful, including:
               the sparking mechanisms in lighters and various toys, using ferrocerium (the "flint" in lighters); starting fires without
               matches, using a firesteel; the flintlock mechanism in firearms; and spark testing metals.
