            <td class="JF">The standard enthalpy change of vapourisation is a physical property of substances. It is defined as the amount of heat (or
               energy) required per unit mass of a substance to completely vapourize the substance at its <a class="glink" href="gbp.htm">boiling point</a>. The heat of vapourization is expressed in kJ/mol (kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), or calories/gram. The use of kJ/kg is also possible, but less customary. Other units still in use in certain places include
               Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound).

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">Because vapourisation is the opposite process of condensation, the term heat of condensation is also used. The latter is defined
               as the heat released when a unit mass of a substance is completely condensed at its <a class="glink" href="gbp.htm">boiling point</a>.

            <td class="JF">The standard enthalpy change of vapourization of water is about 2260 kJ/kg which is equal to 40.8 kJ/mol. This is quite a
               lot: it is five times the energy needed for heating the water from 0&deg;C to 100&deg;C.
