            <td class="JF">In materials that exhibit <b>antiferromagnetism</b>, the spins of electrons align in a regular pattern with neighboring spins pointing in opposite directions. This is a different
               manifestation of magnetism. Generally, antiferromagnetic materials exhibit antiferromagnetism at a low <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>, and become disordered above a certain <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>; the transition <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> is called the Neel <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>. Above the Neel <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>, the material is typically paramagnetic.

            <td class="JF"><b>Diamagnetism</b> is a form of magnetism which is only exhibited by a substance in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. It
               is the result of changes in the orbital motion of electrons due to the application of an externally applied magnetic field.
               Applying a magnetic field creates a magnetic force on a moving <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> in the form of F = qv.B . This force changes the centripetal force on the <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a>, causing it to either speed up or slow down in its orbital motion. This changed <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> speed modifies the magnetic moment of the orbital in a direction opposing the external field.

            <td class="JF">All materials show a diamagnetic response in an applied magnetic field; however for materials which show some other form of
               magnetism (such as ferromagnetism or paramagnetism), the diamagnetism is completely swamped. Substances which only, or mostly,
               display diamagnetic behaviour are termed diamagnetic materials, or diamagnets. Materials that are said to be diamagnetic are
               those which are usually considered by non-physicists as "non magnetic", and include water, DNA, most organic compounds such
               as oil and plastic, and many metals such as <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a> and <a class="elink" href="83.htm">bismuth</a>.

            <td class="JF"><b>Ferrimagnetic</b> materials are those in which the magnetic moment of the atoms on different sublattices are opposed, as in antiferromagnetism;
               however, in ferrimagnetic materials, the opposing moments are unequal and a spontaneous magnetization remains. This happens
               when the sublattices consist of different materials or <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ions</a> (such as Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>).

            <td class="JF">Ferrimagnetic materials are like ferromagnets in that they hold a spontaneous magnetization below the Curie <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>, and show no magnetic order (are paramagnetic) above this <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>. However, there is sometimes a <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> below the Curie <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> at which the two sublattices have equal moments, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero; this is called the compensation
               point. The compensation point is observed easily in garnets.

            <td class="JF">Ferrimagnetism is exhibited by ferrites and magnetic garnets. The oldest-known magnetic substance, magnetite, is a ferrimagnet;
               it was originally classified as a ferromagnet before Neel's discovery of ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism.

            <td class="JF"><b>Ferromagnetism</b> is the "normal" form of magnetism which most people are familiar with, as exhibited in horseshoe magnets and refrigerator
               magnets, for instance. It is responsible for most of the magnetic behavior encountered in everyday life. All permanent magnets
               are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, as are the metals that are noticeably attracted to them.

            <td class="JF">Historically, the term "ferromagnet" was used for any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic
               moment in the absence of an external magnetic field. This general definition is still in common use. More recently, however,
               different classes of spontaneous magnetization have been identified when there is more than one magnetic ion per primitive
               cell of the material, leading to a stricter definition of "ferromagnetism" that is often used to distinguish it from ferrimagnetism.
               In particular, a material is "ferromagnetic" in this narrower sense only if all of its magnetic ions add a positive contribution
               to the net magnetization. If some of the magnetic ions subtract from the net magnetization (if they are partially anti-aligned),
               then the material is "ferrimagnetic". If the ions anti-align completely so as to have zero net magnetization, despite the
               magnetic ordering, then it is an antiferromagnet. All of these alignment effects only occur at <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperatures</a> below a certain critical <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>, called the Curie <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> (for ferromagnets and ferrimagnets) or the Neel <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> (for antiferromagnets).

            <td class="JF"><b>Paramagnetism</b> is a form of magnetism which only occurs in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials
               are attracted to magnetic fields, hence have a relative magnetic permeability greater than unity (or, equivalently, a positive
               magnetic susceptibility). However, unlike ferromagnets which are also attracted to magnetic fields, paramagnets do not retain
               any magnetisation in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field.
