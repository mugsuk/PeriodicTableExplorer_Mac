            <td class="JF">Heat capacity (usually denoted by a capital C, often with subscripts) is a measurable physical quantity that characterizes
               the ability of a body to store heat as it changes in <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>. It is defined as the rate of change of <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> as heat is added to a body at the given conditions and state of the body (foremost its <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>). In the International System of Units, heat capacity is expressed in units of joules per kelvin. It is termed an "extensive
               quantity" because it is sensitive to the size of the object (for example, a bathtub of water has a greater heat capacity than
               a cup of water). Dividing heat capacity by the body's mass yields a specific heat capacity (also called more properly "mass-specific
               heat capacity" or more loosely "specific heat"), which is an "intensive quantity," meaning it is no longer dependent on amount
               of material, and is now more dependent on the type of material, as well as the physical conditions of heating.
