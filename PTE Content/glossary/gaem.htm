               extrudable and machinable. These elements may be made into rods, wire or plate. Also, these elements are less reactive than
               the <a class="glink" href="galkalimetal.htm">alkali metals</a> and have higher <a class="glink" href="gmp.htm">melting points</a> and <a class="glink" href="gbp.htm">boiling points</a>.

            <td class="JF">The alkaline earth metals are silvery coloured, soft, low-density metals, which react readily with <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogens</a> to form ionic salts, and with water, though not as rapidly as the alkali metals, to form strongly alkaline (basic) hydroxides.
               For example, where <a class="elink" href="11.htm">sodium</a> and <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a> react with water at room temperature, magnesium reacts only with steam and <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> with hot water.

            <td class="JF">All the alkaline earth metals have two <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> in their outermost shell, so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> shell is to lose two <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> to form doubly charged positive <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ions</a>.
