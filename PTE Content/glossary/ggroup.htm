            <td class="JF">The new <a class="glink" href="giupac.htm">IUPAC</a> system, which numbers each column with Arabic numbers from 1 (one) through 18 (eighteen). To reduce confusion caused by the
               other two systems, this is the system that is used in articles on this web site.

            <td class="JF">The old <a class="glink" href="giupac.htm">IUPAC</a> system, which labeled columns with Roman numerals followed by either the letter 'A' or 'B'. Columns were numbed such that
               columns one through seven were numbered 'IA' through 'VIIA', columns 8 through 10 were labeled 'VIIIA', columns 11 through
               17 were numbered 'IB' through 'VIIB' and column 18 was numbered 'VIII'.

            <td class="JF">The CAS system, which also used Roman numerals followed by an 'A' or 'B'. This method, however, labeled columns 1 and 2 as
               'IA' and 'IIA', columns 3 through 7 as 'IIIB' through 'VIB', column 8 through 10 as 'VIII', columns 11 and 12 as 'IB' and
               'IIB' and columns 13 through 18 as 'IIIA' through 'VIIIA'.

            <td class="JF"><a class="glink" href="gelement.htm">Elements</a> are arranged in these groups according to whose proprieties are similar. All elements in Group 1 for instance are <a class="glink" href="galkalimetal.htm">alkali metals</a>. They have only one <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> in the outer shell (valence electron) and as a result are highly reactive. Elements in Group 17 are the <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogens</a>. They all have seven <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> in the outer orbital (two in level s and five in level p). They are also very reactive because they have seven <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> in the outer shell and will readily accept an <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> in order to reach the <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a> configuration with the ideal number of eight <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> in the outer shell. Elements Group 18 have a complete outer shell with eight <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a>. These <a class="glink" href="gnoble.htm">noble gases</a> are highly stable and do not react to form <a class="glink" href="gcompound.htm">compounds</a> under normal conditions.
