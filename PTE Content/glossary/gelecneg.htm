            <td class="JF">Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> or <a class="glink" href="gmolecule.htm">molecule</a> to attract electrons in the context of a chemical bond. The type of bond formed is largely determined by the difference in
               electronegativity between the atoms involved. Atoms with similar electronegativities will share an electron with each other
               and form a covalent bond. However, if the difference is too great, the electron will be permanently transferred to one atom
               and an ionic bond will form. Furthermore, in a covalent bond if one atom pulls slightly harder than the other, a polar covalent
               bond will form.

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">No electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a pure non-polar covalent bond. A small electronegativity difference
               leads to a polar covalent bond. A large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond.
