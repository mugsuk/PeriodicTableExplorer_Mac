            <td class="JF">Aqua regia is a higly corrosive, fuming yellow or red solution. It is a mixture of (usually) 1 part nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) to three parts hydrochloric acid (HCl). It is one of the few <a class="glink" href="greagent.htm">reagent</a>s that can dissolve <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a> and <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a>.

            <td class="JF">Aqua regia is itself very corrosive and has been implicated in several explosions as well due to mishandling and it should
               not be used unless gentler cleaning techniques are inadequate.

            <td class="JF">Due to the reaction between its components resulting in its decomposition, aqua regia quickly loses its effectiveness. As
               such, its components should only be mixed immediately before use.
