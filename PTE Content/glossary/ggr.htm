            <td class="JF">Extremely short wavelength and intensely high-energy electromagnetic <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a>. Gamma rays originate from an atom's <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nucleus</a> and normally accompany <a class="glink" href="gap.htm">alpha</a> and <a class="glink" href="gbetap.htm">beta</a> particles as part of the emissions of the <a class="glink" href="gradioactive.htm">radioactive</a> decay of an <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> and always accompany nuclear fission. Because gamma rays are energy and not matter, they are very penetrating and can cause
               damage to animal and plant tissues. Gamma rays are absorbed by extremely dense materials like <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead (Pb)</a> and depleted <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium (U)</a>.

            <td class="JF">Gamma rays, <a class="glink" href="gxr.htm">x-rays</a>, visible light, and Ultraviolet (UV) rays are all forms of electromagnetic <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a>. The only difference is the frequency and hence the energy of the photons. Gamma rays are the most energetic.

            <td class="JF">The powerful nature of gamma rays have made them useful in the sterilizing of medical equipment by killing bacteria. They
               are also used to kill bacteria and insects in foodstuffs, particularly meat and vegetables, to maintain freshness.

            <td class="JF">In spite of their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of cancer. In the procedure called
               gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed on the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells.
               The beams are aimed from different angles to focus the <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a> on the growth while minimising damage to the surrounding tissues.

            <td class="JF">Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in nuclear medicine. Several gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used, one of
               which is <a class="elink" href="43.htm">technetium-99m</a>. When administered to a patient, a gamma camera can be used to form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting
               the gamma <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a> emitted. Such a technique can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (e.g. spread of cancer to the bones).
