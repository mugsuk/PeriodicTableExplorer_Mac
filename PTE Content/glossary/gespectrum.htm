            <td class="JF">An <a class="glink" href="gelement.htm">element's</a> emission spectrum is the relative intensity of electromagnetic radiation of each frequency it emits when it is heated (or
               more generally when it is excited).

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">When the <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> in the element are excited, they jump to higher energy levels. As the electrons fall back down, and leave the excited state,
               energy is re-emitted, the wavelength of which refers to the discrete lines of the emission spectrum. [Note however that the
               emission extends over a range of frequencies, an effect called spectral line broadening.]

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">The emission spectrum can be used to determine the composition of a material, since it is different for each <a class="glink" href="gelement.htm">element</a> of the <a class="glink" href="gpt.htm">periodic table</a>. One example is identifying the composition of stars by analysing the received light.

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">An <a class="glink" href="gaspectrum.htm">absorption spectrum</a> occurs when light passes through a cold, dilute gas and <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atoms</a> in the gas absorb at characteristic frequencies; since the re-emitted light is unlikely to be emitted in the same direction
               as the absorbed photon, this gives rise to dark lines (absence of light) in the spectrum. The light emitted from an excited
               atom can not be directed toward the observer, so the light appears to be missing from the continuous spectrum.
