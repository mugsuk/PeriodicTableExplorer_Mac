            <td class="JF">Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to deform under shear stress. It is commonly perceived as "thickness",
               or resistance to pouring. Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of
               fluid friction. Thus, water is "thin", having a lower viscosity, while vegetable oil is "thick" having a higher viscosity.
               All real fluids (except superfluids) have some resistance to shear stress, but an idealized fluid which has no resistance
               to shear stress is known as an ideal fluid.
