            <td class="JF">Alpha decay is one process that unstable atoms can use to become more stable. During alpha decay, an atom's nucleus sheds
               two <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">protons</a> and two <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutrons</a> in a packet that scientists call an alpha particle.

            <td class="JF">Since an atom loses two <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">protons</a> during alpha decay, it changes from one element to another. For example, after undergoing alpha decay, an atom of <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> (with 92 protons) becomes an atom of <a class="elink" href="90.htm">thorium</a> (with 90 <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">protons</a>).

            <td class="JF">Note that an alpha particle IS a <a class="elink" href="2.htm">helium</a> nucleus, and that both mass number and <a class="glink" href="gan.htm">atomic number</a> are conserved. Alpha decay can essentially be thought of as nuclear fission where the parent <a class="elink" href="nucleus.htm">nucleus</a> splits into two daughter <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nuclei</a>. Alpha decay is fundamentally a quantum tunneling process. Unlike beta decay, alpha decay is governed by the strong nuclear
               force.

            <td class="JF">Because of alpha decay, virtually all of the <a class="elink" href="2.htm">helium</a> produced in the United States and elsewhere comes from trapped underground deposits associated with minerals containing <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> or <a class="elink" href="90.htm">thorium</a>, and brought to the surface as a by-product of natural gas production.

            <td class="JF">Alpha particles emitted by radioactive <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nuclei</a> are among the most hazardous forms of <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a>, if these <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nuclei</a> are incorporated within a human body. As any heavy <a class="glink" href="gatc.htm">charged</a> particle, alpha particles lose their energy within a very short distance in dense media, causing significant damage to surrounding
               biomolecules. On the other hand, external alpha irradiation is not harmful because alpha particles are completely absorbed
               by a very thin (micrometers) dead layer of skin as well as by few centimeters of air. However, if a substance radiating alpha
               particles is injected, ingested or inhaled by an organism it may become a risk, potentially inflicting very serious damage
               to the organisms' genetic makeup.
