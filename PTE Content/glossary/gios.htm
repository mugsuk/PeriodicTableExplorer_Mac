            <td class="JF">The island of stability is a term from nuclear physics that describes the possibility of elements with particularly stable
               "<a class="glink" href="gmn.htm">magic numbers</a>" of <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">protons</a> and <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutrons</a>. This would allow certain <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> of some transuranic elements to be far more stable than others, that is, decay much more slowly.

            <td class="JF">The idea of the island of stability was first proposed by <a class="blink" href="bgts.htm">Glenn T. Seaborg</a>. The hypothesis is that the atomic <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nucleus</a> is built up in "shells" in a manner similar to the electron shells in <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atoms</a>. In both cases shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from
               quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap. So when the numbers of <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutrons</a> and <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">protons</a> completely fill the energy levels of a given shell in the <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nucleus</a>, then the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local minimum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer
               lifetime than nearby <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> that do not have filled shells

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">A filled shell would have "magic numbers" of <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutrons</a> and <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">protons</a>. One possible magic number of neutrons is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126 - which would
               mean that the most stable possible <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> would be <a class="elink" href="114.htm">ununquadium-298</a>, unbinilium-304 and <a class="elink" href="116.htm">unbihexium-310</a>. Of particular note is Ubh-310, which would be "<a class="glink" href="gdm.htm">doubly magic</a>" (both its proton number of 126 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic) and thus the most likely to have a very
               long <a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a>. (The next lighter doubly-magic nucleus is <a class="elink" href="82.htm">Lead-208</a>, the heaviest stable <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nucleus</a> and most stable heavy metal.) None of these transuranic isotopes has yet been produced, but <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> of elements in the range between 110 through 114 are slower to decay than <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> of nearby <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nuclei</a> on the <a class="glink" href="gpt.htm">periodic table</a>.
