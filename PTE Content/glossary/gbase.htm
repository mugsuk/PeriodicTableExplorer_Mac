            <td class="JF">Bases can be thought of as the chemical opposite of acids. A reaction between an acid and base is called neutralization. Bases
               and acids are seen as opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium ion (H3O+) concentration in water,
               whereas bases reduce this concentration. Bases react with acids to produce water and salts (or their solutions).

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">A weak base is a chemical base that does not ionize fully in an aqueous solution. As bases are proton acceptors, a weak base
               may also be defined as a chemical base in which protonation is incomplete. This results in a relatively low pH level compared
               to strong bases. Bases range from a <a class="glink" href="gph.htm">pH</a> of greater than 7 (7 is neutral, like pure water) to 14 (though some bases are greater than 14).

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">A strong base is a base which hydrolyzes completely, raising the <a class="glink" href="gph.htm">pH</a> of the solution towards 14. Strong bases, like strong acids, attack living tissue and cause serious burns.
