For instance, <a class="elink" href="2.htm">helium</a> has only one <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> per molecule. The <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a> molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) contains two atoms, as do <a class="elink" href="17.htm">chlorine</a> (Cl<sub>2</sub>), <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> (H<sub>2</sub>) and <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a> (N<sub>2</sub>).

            <td class="JF">Some molecules are huge having a molecular weight in the millions. Macromolecules contain literally thousands of <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atoms</a>. Some macromolecules must remain in tact in order to retain their chemical entity. These are usually proteins. Polymers are
               chains or networks of repeating sequences of chemical units known as molecules. Examples are polypropylene or cellulose. Molecules
               of polymers can be broken without destroying the chemical integrity.
