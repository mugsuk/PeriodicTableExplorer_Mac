            <td class="JF">X-rays have smaller wavelengths and therefore higher energy than ultraviolet waves. We usually talk about X-rays in terms
               of their energy rather than wavelength. This is partially because X-rays have very small wavelengths. It is also because X-ray
               light tends to act more like a particle than a wave. X-ray detectors collect actual photons of X-ray light.

            <td class="JF">X-rays were first observed and documented in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, a German scientist who found them quite by accident
               when experimenting with vacuum tubes.

            <td class="JF">A week later, he took an X-ray photograph of his wife's hand which clearly revealed her wedding ring and her bones. The photograph
               electrified the general public and aroused great scientific interest in the new form of <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a>. Roentgen called it "X" to indicate it was an unknown type of <a class="glink" href="gradiation.htm">radiation</a>. The name stuck, although (over Roentgen's objections), many of his colleagues suggested calling them Roentgen rays. They
               are still occasionally referred to as Roentgen rays in German-speaking countries.
