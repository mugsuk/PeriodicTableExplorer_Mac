            <td class="JF">Radiation (radiant energy): energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Different forms of radiation comprise the electromagnetic
               spectrum and are characterised by their different wave frequency and wavelength. Radiation is emitted from matter in the form
               of <a class="glink" href="gphoton.htm">photons</a>.

            <td class="JF">The following types of radiation make up the electromagnetic spectrum (in order of decreasing energy and increasing wavelength):
               cosmic rays, <a class="glink" href="ggr.htm">gamma rays</a>, <a class="glink" href="gxr.htm">x-rays</a>, UV (ultraviolet) rays, visible light rays, infrared, microwave, radio (Hertzian) waves and electric waves. These electromagnetic
               waves have no mass and are not electrically charged. The shortest wavelength forms of radiation are most penetrating and are
               the most damaging to living tissue.
