Elements in Period 1 has only one shell. As you probably recall, the elements in the first period have a 2 electrons maximum
               (<a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> has 1 electron and <a class="elink" href="2.htm">helium</a> has 2 electrons. As we move to the first group of the second period, we find that <a class="elink" href="3.htm">lithium</a>, which has the two electrons in the first shell and one in the second. <a class="elink" href="10.htm">Neon</a> is in Group 18 of Period 2 and therefore has the two electrons in the first shell and eight electrons in the second shell.
               <a class="elink" href="11.htm">Sodium</a> starts Period 3 with 11 electrons, two in the first shell, eight in the second shell and one in the third shell. In other
               words, the element in Group 1 always has one more electron (in a new shell) than the Group 18 element in the previous period.
