            <td class="JF">The Brinell scale characterises the indentation hardness of materials through the scale of penetration of an indenter, loaded
               on a material test-piece. It is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science.

            <td class="JF">Brinelling refers to surface fatigue caused by repeated impact or overloading. It is a common cause of roller bearing failures,
               and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. Engineers will use the Brinell hardness of materials
               in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. Fretting corrosion can cause a similar-looking kind of damage and is
               called false brinelling since the mechanism is different.

            <td class="JF">Proposed by Swedish engineer Johan August Brinell in 1900, it was the first widely used and standardised hardness test in
               engineering and metallurgy. The large size of indentation and possible damage to test-piece limits its usefulness.
