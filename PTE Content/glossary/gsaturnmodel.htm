            <td class="JF">In 1904 Nagaoka Hantaro developed this model of the atom. It was based around an analogy to the explanation of the stability
               of the rings of Saturn; the rings are stable because the planet they orbit is very massive). Two predictions were made by
               the model:

            <td class="JF">a) a very massive nucleus (in analogy to a very massive planet)</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="JF">b) electrons revolving around the nucleus, bound by electrostatic forces (in analogy to the rings revolving around Saturn,
               bound by gravitational forces)
            </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="JF">Both predictions were successfully confirmed by Rutherford (who mentions Nagaoka's model in his 1911 paper in which the nucleus
               is proposed). However, other details of the model were incorrect (in particular, charged rings would be unstable due to repulsive
               disruption, which is not the case with Saturn's rings), and Nagaoka himself abandoned it in 1908.
