            <td class="JF">The standard enthalpy change of fusion, also known as the heat of fusion, is the amount of thermal energy which must be absorbed
               or lost for 1 gram of a substance to change states from a solid to a liquid or vice versa. It is also called the latent heat
               of fusion or the enthalpy of fusion, and the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> at which it occurs is called the <a class="glink" href="gmp.htm">melting point</a>.

         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="JF">When you withdraw thermal energy from a liquid or solid, the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> falls. When you add heat energy the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> rises. However, at the transition point between solid and liquid (the <a class="glink" href="gmp.htm">melting point</a>), extra energy is required (the heat of fusion). To go from liquid to solid, the <a class="glink" href="gmolecule.htm">molecules</a> of a substance must become more ordered. For them to maintain the order of a solid, extra heat must be withdrawn. In the
               other direction, to create the disorder from the solid crystal to liquid, extra heat must be added.

            <td class="JF">The heat of fusion can be observed if you measure the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> of water as it freezes. If you plunge a closed container of room <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> water into a very cold environment (say -20&deg;C), you will see the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> fall steadily until it drops just below the freezing point (0&deg;C). The <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> then rebounds and holds steady while the water crystalises. Once completely frozen, the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> will fall steadily again.

            <td class="JF">The <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> stops falling at (or just below) the freezing point due to the heat of fusion. The energy of the heat of fusion must be withdrawn
               (the liquid must turn to solid) before the <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> can continue to fall.
