All of these <a class="glink" href="gelement.htm">elements</a> are electronegative. The halogens show a number of trends when moving down the group - for instance, decreasing electronegativity
               and reactivity, increasing <a class="glink" href="gmp.htm">melting</a> and <a class="glink" href="gbp.htm">boiling point</a>.

            <td class="JF">Halogens are highly reactive, and as such can be harmful or lethal to biological organisms in sufficient quantities. This
               high reactivity is due to their <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atoms</a> being one <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> short of a full outer shell of <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a>. They can gain this <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> by reacting with <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atoms</a> of other elements. <a class="elink" href="9.htm">Fluorine</a> is the most reactive element in existence, attacking such inert materials as glass, and forming compounds with the heavier
               noble gases. It is a corrosive and highly toxic gas. The reactivity of <a class="elink" href="9.htm">fluorine</a> is such that, if used or stored in laboratory glassware, it can react with glass in the presence of small amounts of water
               to form SiF<sub>4</sub>. Thus fluorine must be handled with substances such as Teflon, extremely dry glass, or metals such as copper or steel which
               form a protective layer of fluoride on their surface.

            <td class="JF">Both <a class="elink" href="17.htm">chlorine</a> and <a class="elink" href="35.htm">bromine</a> are used as disinfectants for drinking water, swimming pools, fresh wounds, dishes, and surfaces. They kill bacteria and
               other potentially harmful microorganisms through a process known as sterilization. Their reactivity is also put to use in
               bleaching. <a class="elink" href="17.htm">Chlorine</a> is the active ingredient of most fabric bleaches and is used in the production of most paper products.
