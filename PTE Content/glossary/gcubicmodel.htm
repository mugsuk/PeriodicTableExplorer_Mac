            <td class="JF">An early atomic model in which <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> were positioned at the eight corners of a cube. The theory was developed by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1902 and published in 1916
               in the famous article "The Atom and the Molecule" which used the theory to account for the phenomenon of <a class="glink" href="gvalency.htm">valency</a>.

            <td class="JF">The cubic model of the atom was soon abondoned in favour of the quantum mechanical model based on the Shrodinger equation.
               But it is still of historical interest as it represented an important step towards the understanding of the chemical bond.
