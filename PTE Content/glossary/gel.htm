Electrons are located in energy levels a term which has replaced the word shells, which was once used to describe the location
               of electrons. The word shell suggests a fixed position, which is far from reality. We will use energy level to describe the
               possible location of electrons.

            <td class="JF">There are seven energy levels. Each has a specific maximum number of <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> that can exist in it. The number of <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a>, which an energy level can hold is equal to 2n2 where n = energy level. The letter n represents the principal quantum number
               that specifies the energy level of the atom in which an electron is located. The chart below identifies the various energy
               levels and maximum number of electrons possible. The energy level closest to the nucleus is represented by energy level 1.
