            <td class="JF">A model of the <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> devised by Ernest Rutherford. This new model for the atom, based on the experimental results, had the new features of a relatively
               high central charge concentrated into a very small volume in comparison to the rest of the atom and containing the bulk of
               the atomic mass (the nucleus of the atom).

            <td class="JF">Rutherford's model did not make any new headway in explaining the electron-structure of the atom; in this regard Rutherford
               merely mentioned earlier atomic models in which a number of tiny electrons circled the nucleus like planets around the sun,
               or a ring around a planet (such as Saturn). However, by implication, Rutherford's concentration of most of the atom's mass
               into a very small core made a planetary model an even more likely metaphor than before, as such a core would contain most
               of the atom's mass, in an analogous way to the Sun containing most of the solar system's mass.
