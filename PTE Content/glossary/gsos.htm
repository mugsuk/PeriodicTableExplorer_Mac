            <td class="JF">The speed of sound is a term used to describe the speed of sound waves passing through an elastic medium. The speed varies
               with the medium employed (for example, sound waves move faster through water than through air), as well as with the properties
               of the medium, especially <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a>. The term is commonly used to refer specifically to the speed of sound in air. At sea level, at a <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperature</a> of 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) and under normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of sound is 344 m.s<sup>-1</sup> (1225 km.h<sup>-1</sup> or 761 mph).
