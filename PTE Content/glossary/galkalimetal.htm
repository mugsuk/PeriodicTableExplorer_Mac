            <td class="JF">The alkali metals are silver-colored (<a class="elink" href="55.htm">caesium</a> has a golden tinge), soft, low-density metals, which react readily with <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogens</a> to form ionic salts, and with water to form strongly alkaline (basic) hydroxides. These elements all have one electron in
               their outermost shell, so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled electron shell is to lose one electron to
               form a singly charged positive <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a>, or <a class="glink" href="gcation.htm">cation</a>.

            <td class="JF"><a class="elink" href="1.htm">Hydrogen</a>, with a solitary <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a>, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the <a class="glink" href="gpt.htm">periodic table</a>, but it is not considered an alkali metal; rather it exists naturally as a diatomic gas. Removal of its single electron requires
               considerably more energy than removal of the outer <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> for the alkali metals. As in the <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogens</a>, only one additional <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> is required to fill in the outermost shell of the <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a>, so <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> can in some circumstances behave like a <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogen</a>, forming the negative hydride <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a>. Binary compounds of hydride with the alkali metals and some transition metals have been prepared. Under extremely high pressure,
               such as is found at the core of Jupiter, <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal
