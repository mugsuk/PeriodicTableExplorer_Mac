            <td class="JF">The oxidation state is a measure of the degree of oxidation (the loss of an <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> by a <a class="glink" href="gmolecule.htm">molecule</a>, <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> or <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a>) of an atom in a chemical compound. It is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different
               elements were 100% ionic. Oxidation states are represented by Arabic numerals, and are always associated with a sign (positive
               or negative) unless zero. Thus, a <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a>, which is nothing more than a <a class="glink" href="gproton.htm">proton</a>, would have an oxidation state of 1+.

         <tr>
            <td class="JF">The increase in oxidation state of an atom is known as an oxidation: a decrease in oxidation state is known as a <a class="glink" href="greduction.htm">reduction</a> (gain of an <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electron</a> by a <a class="glink" href="gmolecule.htm">molecule</a>, <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> or <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a>). Such reactions involve the transfer of electrons, a net gain in electrons being a reduction and a net loss of electrons
               being an oxidation.
