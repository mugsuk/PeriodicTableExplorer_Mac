            <td class="JF">An electronvolt (symbol eV) is (technically) the amount of kinetic energy gained by a single unbound electron when it passes
               through an electrostatic potential difference of one volt, in vacuum. The one-word spelling is the modern recommendation although
               the use of the earlier electron volt still exists. It is used to represent either very small amounts of energy or very small
               masses.

            <td class="JF">Einstein reasoned that energy is equivalent to (rest) mass, as famously expressed in the formula E=mc<sup>2</sup>. It is thus common in particle physics, where mass and energy are often interchanged, to use eV/c<sup>2</sup> or even simply eV as a unit of mass. (Although the latter is only strictly valid when working in natural units where c=1.)
