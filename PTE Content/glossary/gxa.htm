            <td class="JF">Abundance in context of the Periodic Table Isotope pages refers to Natural Abundance; the prevalence of different <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> of an element as found in Earth naturally. The weighted (by natural abundance) average mass of these <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> is the atomic weight listed for the element in the periodic table. The abundance of an element varies from planet to planet.

            <td class="JF">Percent natural abundances refer to the relative proportions, expressed as percentages by number, in which the <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> of an element are found in natural sources.

            <td class="JF">"Synthetic" refers to a synthetic <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotope</a>, that is, a radionuclide that is not found in nature: no natural process or mechanism exists which produces it, or it is
               so unstable that it decays away in a very short period of time. Examples include <a class="elink" href="43.htm">Technetium-95</a> and <a class="elink" href="61.htm">Promethium-146</a>. Many of these are found in, and harvested from, spent nuclear fuel assemblies. Some must be manufactured in particle accelerators.
