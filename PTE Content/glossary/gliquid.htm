            <td class="JF">A liquid's shape is determined by the container it fills. That is to say, liquid particles (normally molecules or clusters
               of molecules) are free to move about the volume, but they form a discrete surface that may not necessarily be the same as
               the vessel. The same cannot be said about a gas; it can also be considered a fluid (things that flows, including gas), but
               it must conform to the shape of the container entirely.
