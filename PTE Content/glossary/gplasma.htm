            <td class="JF">A plasma is a partially <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ionized</a> gas, in which a certain proportion of <a class="glink" href="gelectron.htm">electrons</a> are free rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative charges to move somewhat
               independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore
               has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids, or gases and is considered to be a distinct state of matter. Plasma
               typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds, as seen, for example, in the case of stars. Like gas, plasma does not
               have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container; unlike gas, in the influence of a magnetic field,
               it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers.
