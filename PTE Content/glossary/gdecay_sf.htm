            <td class="JF">Spontaneous fission (SF) is a form of radioactive decay characteristic of very heavy <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a>, and is theoretically possible for any atomic nucleus whose mass is greater than or equal to 100 amu (elements near ruthenium).
               In practice, however, spontaneous fission is only energetically feasible for atomic masses above 230 amu (elements near thorium).
               The elements most susceptible to spontaneous fission are the <a class="glink" href="gtransactinides.htm">transactinide</a> elements, such as <a class="elink" href="104.htm">rutherfordium</a>.

            <td class="JF">For <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> and <a class="elink" href="90.htm">thorium</a>, the spontaneous fission mode of decay does occur but is not seen for the majority of radioactive breakdowns and is usually
               neglected except for the exact considerations of branching ratios when determining the activity of a sample containing these
               elements. Mathematically, the criterion for whether spontaneous fission can occur is:

            <td class="JF">As the name suggests, spontaneous fission follows the exact same process as nuclear fission, only it is not self-sustaining
               and does not generate the <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutron</a> flux necessary to "go critical" and continue such fissions. However, spontaneous fissions release neutrons as all fissions
               do, so radioisotopes for which spontaneous fission is a nonnegligible decay mode may be used as neutron sources; <a class="elink" href="98.htm">californium-252</a> (<a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a> 2.645 years, SF branch ratio 3.09%) is often used for this purpose. The <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutrons</a> may then be used to inspect airline luggage for hidden explosives, to gauge the moisture content of soil in the road construction
               and building industries, to measure the moisture of materials stored in silos, and in other applications.

            <td class="JF">The spontaneous fission of <a class="ilink" href="i92.htm">uranium-238</a> leaves trails of damage in uranium containing minerals as the fission fragments recoil through the crystal structure. These
               trails, or fission tracks provide the basis for the radiometric dating technique: fission track dating.
