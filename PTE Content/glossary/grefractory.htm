            <td class="JF">Refractory materials retain their strength at high <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperatures</a>. They are used to make crucibles and to make refractory linings, which line furnaces, kilns and incinerators. The oxides
               of <a class="elink" href="12.htm">magnesium</a> (magnesite) and <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> (lime) are the most important refractory materials, though fireclay is widely used as well. Zirconia is used when the material
               must withstand extremely high <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperatures</a>. <a class="elink" href="14.htm">Silicon</a> <a class="elink" href="6.htm">carbide</a> is another refractory material. It is very strong at high <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperatures</a>, but will burn in the presence of <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a>, if the protective silica coating comes off. Refractories must be chosen according to the conditions they will face. For
               example, <a class="elink" href="6.htm">carbon</a> cannot be used when it will be in contact with <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a>, as it will burn. Acidic refractories cannot be used in a basic environment and basic refractories cannot be used in acidic
               environment because they will be eroded. Zircon, fireclay and silica are acidic, dolomite and magnesite are basic and alumina,
               chromite, <a class="elink" href="14.htm">silicon</a> carbide, carbon and mullite are neutral. Refractory materials must be strong at high <a class="glink" href="gtemp.htm">temperatures</a>, resistant to thermal shock, chemically inert, and have low thermal conductivities and coefficients of expansion.
