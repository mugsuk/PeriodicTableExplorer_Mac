                  <tr>
                     <td>White phosphorus is a colourless to yellow, transparent, crystalline solid which darkens on exposure to light. The yellow
                        colouring results from impurities. It has a waxy appearance, high electrical resistivity, is insoluble in water and alcohol,
                        but is soluble in carbon disulfide, some organic solvents, and oils, and has phosphorescent properties at room temperature.
                        When exposed to air, phosphorus emits white fumes and can spontaneously ignite. Therefore, it should be stored under water.
                        White phosphorus can form compounds with <a class="glink" href="ghalogens.htm">halogens</a>, <a class="elink" href="16.htm">sulfur</a>, metals, nitric acid, and alkali hydroxides.
