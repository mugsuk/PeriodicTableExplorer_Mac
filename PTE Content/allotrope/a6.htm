                        Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for this effect.

                        well as for high temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices. It was first produced by workers at
                        the laboratories of The General Electric Company, UK, in the early 1960s, using cellulose as the starting material. A short
                        time later, Japanese workers produced a similar material from phenolic resin. The preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting
                        the organic precursors to a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000oC. Unlike many non-graphitizing carbons,
                        they are impermeable to gases and are chemically extremely inert, especially those which have been prepared at very high temperatures.
                        It has been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapour are
                        lower than those of any other carbon. They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal graphite is reduced
                        to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such
                        treatment, even after several months.
