            <td class="JF">Iodine was discovered by <a class="blink" href="bbc.htm">Bernard Courtois</a> in 1811. He was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (a vital part of gunpowder). At the time <a class="slink" href="mfr.htm">France</a> was at war, saltpeter, a component of gunpowder, was in great demand. Saltpeter produced from French niter beds required
               sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed washed up on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium
               carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash then washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid.
               One day <a class="blink" href="bbc.htm">Courtois</a> added too much sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. <a class="blink" href="bbc.htm">Courtois</a> noted that the vapour crystallized on cold surfaces making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this was a new element
               but lacked the money to pursue his observations.

               and Clement made public Courtois' discovery. They described the substance to a meeting of the Imperial Institute of <a class="slink" href="mfr.htm">France</a>. On December 6, Gay-Lussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a <a class="glink" href="gcompound.htm">compound</a> of <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a>. Ampere had given some of his sample to <a class="blink" href="bshd.htm">Humphry Davy</a> (1778 - 1829). Davy did some experiments on the substance and noted its similarity to <a class="elink" href="17.htm">chlorine</a>. Davy sent a letter dated December 10 to the Royal Society of London stating that he had identified a new element. A large
               argument erupted between Davy and <a class="blink" href="bjlgl.htm">Gay-Lussac</a> over who identified iodine first but both scientists acknowledged <a class="blink" href="bbc.htm">Bernard Courtois</a> as the first to isolate the chemical element.
