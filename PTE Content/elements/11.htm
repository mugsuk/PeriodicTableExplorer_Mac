               most abundant element on earth comprising 2.6% of the earth's crust. It is the most abundant of the <a class="glink" href="galkalimetal.htm">alkali metals</a>. It never exists in nature, but is prepared by electrolysis of absolutely dry fused sodium chloride. Sodium chloride is common
               table salt which is important in animal nutrition. Other important forms of sodium are soda ash (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), baking soda (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), Chili saltpeter (NaNO<sub>3</sub>) which is sodium nitrate. In nature sodium is found in soda niter, cryolite (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>), amphibole and zeolite.

               the sodium-water reaction does not scale well, and is treacherous when larger amounts of sodium are used. Larger pieces of
               sodium melt under the heat of the reaction, and the molten ball of metal is buoyed up by hydrogen and appears to be stably
               reacting with water until splashing covers more of the reaction mass, causing thermal runaway and an explosion which scatters
               molten sodium and lye.

Pyromet is a NaCl/(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> mix, with flow/anti-clump agents. It smoothers the fire, drains away heat, and melts to form an impermeable crust. This is
               the standard dry-powder cannister fire extingusher for all classes of fires. Met-L-X is mostly just NaCl, with about 5 % Saran
               as a crust-former, and a couple of flow/anti-clump agents, and is most commonly hand-applied with a scoop. There are also
               other exreme fire extinguishing materials - lith-X is a graphite based dry powder with an organophosphate flame retardant,
               and Na-X is a Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>-based material.
