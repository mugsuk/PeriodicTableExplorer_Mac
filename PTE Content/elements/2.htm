               been lost as it is so light. Just about all the helium remaining on the planet is the result of radioactive decay. While there
               is some helium in the atmosphere, currently its isolation from that source by liquefaction and separation of air is not normally economic. This is because it is easier, and cheaper, to isolate the gas from certain natural gases. Concentrations
               of helium in natural gas in the USA are as high as 7% and other good sources include natural gas from some sources in Poland.
               It is isolable from these gases by liquefaction and separation of from the natural gas. This would not normally be carried
               out in the laboratory and helium is available commercially in cylinders under pressure.

               the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun, by French astronomer Pierre Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India.
               This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a
               yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 line, for it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium, and concluded
               that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. He and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with
               the Greek word for the Sun.

            <td class="JF">On 26 March 1895 British chemist William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite with mineral acids.
               Ramsay was looking for <a class="elink" href="18.htm">argon</a> but, after separating <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a> and <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a> from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid, noticed a bright-yellow line that matched the D<sub>3</sub> line observed in the spectrum of the Sun. These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist <a class="blink" href="bswc.htm">William Crookes</a>. It was independently isolated from cleveite the same year by chemists <a class="blink" href="bptc.htm">Per Teodor Cleve</a> and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, <a class="slink" href="mse.htm">Sweden</a>, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist
               William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the
               mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a>. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.

               liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by
               further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a triple point temperature where the solid, liquid,
               and gas phases are at equilibrium. It was first solidified in 1926 by his student Willem Hendrik Keesom by subjecting helium
               to 25 atmospheres of pressure.
