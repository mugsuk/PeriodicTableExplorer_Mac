               widely known. Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1950's. Objects painted with this paint may still be dangerous,
               and must be handled properly. Currently, <a class="blink" href="i1.htm">tritium</a> is used instead of radium. Although <a class="blink" href="i1.htm">tritium</a> still carries some risks, it is considered by many to be safer than radium.

               <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. They then separated out a radioactive mixture consisting
               mostly of <a class="elink" href="56.htm">barium</a> which gave a brilliant red flame colour and spectral lines which had never been documented before. In 1902 radium was isolated
               into its pure metal by Curie and Andre-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of a pure radium chloride solution by using
               a <a class="elink" href="80.htm">mercury</a> <a class="glink" href="gcathode.htm">cathode</a> and distilling in an atmosphere of <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> gas.

               which included sores, anemia and bone cancer. This use of radium was stopped soon afterward. This is because radium is treated
               as calcium by the body, and deposited in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow, and can mutate bone cells. The litigation
               and ultimate deaths of five "Radium Girl" employees who had used radium-based luminous paints on the dials of watches and
               clocks had a significant impact on the formulation of occupational disease labour law.
