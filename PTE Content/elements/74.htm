               in 1546 as Lupi spuma, meaning "wolf's froth" after the way tin is eaten up like a wolf after sheep in the process of its

               to obtain a new metal by reducing tungstic acid. In 1783 Jose and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid in wolframite that was identical
               to tungstic acid. In <a class="slink" href="mes.htm">Spain</a> later that year the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten through reduction of this <a class="glink" href="gacid.htm">acid</a> with charcoal. They are credited with the discovery of the element.

               as well as the extreme strength of its alloys, made the metal into a very important raw material for the weaponry industry.
