               By the 3rd century, the Chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite. Chinese Daoists were interested in
               sulfur's flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional Chinese
               medicine. A Song Dynasty military treatise of 1044 AD described different formulas for Chinese gun powder, which is a mixture
               of <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a> nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), <a class="elink" href="6.htm">carbon</a>, and sulfur. Early alchemists gave sulfur its own alchemical symbol which was a triangle at the top of a cross.

               In 1867, sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in Louisiana and Texas. The overlying layer of earth was quicksand,
               prohibiting ordinary mining operations. Therefore the Frasch process was utilized.
