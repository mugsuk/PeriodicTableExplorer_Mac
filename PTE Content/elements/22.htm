He recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>) when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby parish of Manaccan and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analysis
               of the sand determined the presence of two metal oxides; <a class="elink" href="26.htm">iron</a> oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Gregor, realizing
               that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element, reported his findings
               to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.

               hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.

               the normal manner, by heating in the presence of carbon, because that produces titanium carbide. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%)
               was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter by heating TiCl<sub>4</sub> with <a class="elink" href="11.htm">sodium</a> in a steel bomb at 700 - 800&deg;C in the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1946 when
               William Justin Kroll proved that it could be commercially produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride with <a class="elink" href="12.htm">magnesium</a> in what came to be known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (FFC
               Cambridge, e.g.), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.
