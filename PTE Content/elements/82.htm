               is highly malleable and ductile as well as easy to smelt. In the early Bronze Age lead was used with <a class="elink" href="51.htm">antimony</a> and <a class="elink" href="33.htm">arsenic</a>. Alchemists thought that lead was the oldest metal and associated it with the planet Saturn. Lead pipes that bear the insignia
               of Roman emperors are still in service and many Roman "pigs" (ingots) of lead figure in Derbyshire lead mining history and
               in the history of the industry in other English centres. Lead's symbol Pb is an abbreviation of its Latin name plumbum for
               soft metals; originally it was plumbum nigrum, where plumbum candidum was tin. The English word "plumbing" also derives from
               this Latin root.

               use of lead in paint pigments was ended because of the danger of lead poisoning, especially to children. By the mid-1980s,
               a significant shift in lead end-use patterns had taken place. Much of this shift was a result of the U.S. lead consumers'
               compliance with environmental regulations that significantly reduced or eliminated the use of lead in nonbattery products,
               including gasoline, paints, solders, and water systems. Recently, lead use is being further curtailed by the European Union's
               RoHS directive. Lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware, vinyl (such as that used for tubing and the insulation
               of electrical cords), and brass manufactured in <a class="slink" href="mcn.htm">China</a>.

               nervous system, causing mental retardation or other nervous disorders. It also affects other organs of the body. People suffering
               from lead poisoning may exhibit weakness, general disability, nervous disorders and eventual death. Children are most susceptible,
               partly because they have rapid metabolism and are small and partly because of their habits. They chew on things that might
               contain lead paint and play on floors and ground that might be contaminated, often putting their fingers in their mouth.

               poisoning occurred in the early 1900's, but the cause of death was only recently determined. A large number of explorer families
               traveled to Alaska. The guide who escorted them contacted many different suppliers for provisions. He got a really good deal
               on canned food that he couldn't refuse. They set out on their journey and were never heard from again. Searchers never found
               any survivors. Years later someone decided to find out what happened. Bodies were found along with provisions. As it turned
               out, the cans had been sealed with lead solder. All of the human remains were very high in lead content. They had, in fact,
               all died of lead poisoning.
