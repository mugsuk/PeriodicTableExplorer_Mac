               references of medicinal uses of zinc in the Charaka Samhita (300 BC). The Rasaratna Samuccaya (800 AD) explains the existence
               of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose.
               Zinc alloys have been used for centuries, as brass goods dating to 1000-1400 BC have been found in <a class="slink" href="mil.htm">Israel</a> and zinc objects with 87% zinc have been found in prehistoric Transylvania. Because of the low <a class="glink" href="gbp.htm">boiling point</a> and high chemical reactivity of this metal (isolated zinc would tend to go up the chimney rather than be captured), the true
               nature of this metal was not understood in ancient times.

               mentions it as pseudo-arguros - "mock silver". The Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul, probably made
               from such zinc remnants.
