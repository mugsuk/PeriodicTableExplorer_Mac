            <td class="JF">The word "tin" has cognates in many Germanic and Celtic languages. The American Heritage Dictionary speculates that the word
               was borrowed from a pre-Indo-European language. The later name "stannum" and its Romance derivatures come from the lead-silver
               alloy of the same name for the finding of the latter in ores; the former "stagnum" was the word for a stale pool or puddle.

Likewise, so-called "tin toys" are usually
               made of steel, and may or may not have a coating of tin to inhibit rust.
