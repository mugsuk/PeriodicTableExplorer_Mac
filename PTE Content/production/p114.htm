            <td>Flerovium was first synthesized in December 1998 by a team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR)
               in Dubna, Russia, led by Yuri Oganessian, who bombarded a target of <a class="elink" href="94.htm">plutonium-244</a> with accelerated nuclei of <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium-48</a>.

            <td>A single atom of flerovium, decaying by alpha emission with a lifetime of 30.4 seconds, was detected. The decay energy measured
               was 9.71 MeV, giving an expected half-life of 2&#8211;23 s. This observation was assigned to the <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotope</a> flerovium-289 and was published in January 1999. The experiment was later repeated, but an <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotope</a> with these decay properties was never found again and hence the exact identity of this activity is unknown. It is possible
               that it was due to the metastable isomer <sup>289m</sup>Fl.
