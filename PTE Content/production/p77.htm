Naturally occurring iridium <a class="glink" href="galloy.htm">alloys</a> include osmiridium and iridiosmium, both of which are mixtures of iridium and <a class="elink" href="76.htm">osmium</a>.

            <td>Iridium is the rarest non-radioactive, non-noble gas element in the Earth's crust, but it is relatively common in meteorites.
               Iridium and <a class="elink" href="76.htm">osmium</a> are the densest elements, and both are believed to have dropped below the Earth's crust toward the core when the Earth was
               young and molten. The concentration of iridium in meteorites matches the concentration of iridium in the Earth as a whole.
