               were examining debris from the first <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> bomb test of November 1952. They discovered the <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotope</a> <sup>253</sup>Es (<a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a> 20.5 days) that was made by the nuclear fusion of 15 <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutrons</a> with <sup>238</sup>U (which then went through seven beta decays). These findings were kept secret until 1955 due to Cold War tensions, however.

            <td>In 1961, enough einsteinium was synthesized to prepare a microscopic amount of <sup>253</sup>Es. This sample weighed about 0.01 mg and was measured using a special balance. The material produced was used to produce
               <a class="elink" href="101.htm">mendelevium</a>. Further einsteinium has been produced at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's High Flux Isotope Reactor in Tennessee by bombarding
