            <td>With an abundance in the Earth's crust similar to <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a>, tellurium is, apart from the precious metals, the rarest stable solid element in the earth's crust. Its abundance by mass
               is less than 0.001 ppm. By comparison, even the rarest of the lanthanoids have crustal abundances of 0.5 ppm, tin and caesium
               have abundances of 2 ppm, and barium of 400 ppm.

            <td>The extreme rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance, which is in fact greater
               than that of <a class="elink" href="37.htm">rubidium</a>, even though <a class="elink" href="37.htm">rubidium</a> is ten thousand times more abundant in the Earth's crust. Rather, the extraordinarily low abundance of tellurium on Earth
               results from the fact that, during the formation of the Earth, the stable form of elements in the absence of <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a> and water was controlled by the oxidation and reduction of <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a>. Under this scenario elements such as tellurium which form volatile hydrides were severely depleted during the formation
               of the Earth's crust through evaporation. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted in the Earth's crust
               by this process.

            <td>Tellurium is sometimes found in its native (elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a> (calaverite, krennerite, petzite, sylvanite, and others). Tellurium compounds are the only chemical compounds of <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a> found in nature, but tellurium itself (unlike <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a>) is also found combined with other elements (in metallic salts). The principal source of tellurium is from <a class="glink" href="ganode.htm">anode</a> sludges produced during the electrolytic refining of blister copper. It is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining
               of lead. Tellurium is produced mainly in the <a class="slink" href="mUS.htm">US</a>, <a class="slink" href="mCA.htm">Canada</a>, <a class="slink" href="mPE.htm">Peru</a>, and <a class="slink" href="mJP.htm">Japan</a>.
