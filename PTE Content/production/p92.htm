            <td>Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is also
               the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is always found combined with other
               elements. Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of <a class="elink" href="26.htm">iron</a>, it is only naturally formed in supernova explosions. The decay of uranium, <a class="elink" href="90.htm">thorium</a> and <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a>-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection,
               which in turn drives plate tectonics.

The Earth's crust from the surface to 25 km (15 mi) down is calculated to contain 10<sup>17</sup> kg of uranium while the oceans may contain 10<sup>13</sup> kg. The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland
               soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and 3 parts per billion of sea water is composed of the element.

               substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered
               commercially from these sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).

               with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used to decontaminate
               uranium-polluted water.

               ore typically contains 0.1 to 0.25% of actual uranium oxides, so extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal
               from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, <a class="slink" href="mCA.htm">Canada</a> can contain up to 70% uranium oxides, and therefore must be diluted with waste rock prior to milling. Uranium ore is crushed
               and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an <a class="glink" href="gacid.htm">acid</a> or alkali. The leachate is then subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange.
               The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities
               from the milling process prior to refining and conversion.

               an expansion of uranium mining, although issues with state governments and indigenous interests complicate the issue.

               The economic incentives resulted in a frenzy of exploration and mining activity throughout the Colorado Plateau from 1947
               through 1959 that left thousands of miles of crudely graded roads spider-webbing the remote deserts of the Colorado Plateau,
               and thousands of abandoned uranium mines, exploratory shafts, and tailings piles. The frenzy ended as suddenly as it had begun,
               when the U.S. government stopped purchasing the uranium.

The ultimate supply of uranium is believed to very large and sufficient for at
               least the next 85 years although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems
               in the 21st century. It is estimated that for a ten times increase in price, the supply of uranium that can be economically
               mined is increased 300 times.
