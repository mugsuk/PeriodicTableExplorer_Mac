            <td>This element is considered to be the 16th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It occurs naturally in the minerals
               leucite, pollucite, and zinnwaldite, which contains traces of up to 1% of its oxide. Lepidolite contains 1.5% rubidium and
               this is the commercial source of the element. Some <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a> minerals and <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a> chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant amounts. One notable source is also in the extensive deposits
               of pollucite at Bernic Lake, <a class="slink" href="mCA.htm">Manitoba</a>. Rubidium metal can be produced by reducing rubidium chloride with <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> among other methods. Rubidium forms at least four oxides: Rb<sub>2</sub>O, Rb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Rb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, RbO<sub>2</sub>. In 1997 the cost of this metal in small quantities was about US$ 25/gram.
