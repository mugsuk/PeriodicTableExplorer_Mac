            <td>Radium is a decay product of <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> and is therefore found in all uranium-bearing ores. Radium was originally acquired from pitchblende ore from Joachimsthal,
               Bohemia (One metric ton of pitchblende yields 0.0001 grams of radium). Carnotite sands in Colorado provide some of the element,
               but richer ores are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes area of Canada, and can also be extracted
               from <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> processing waste. Large <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> deposits are located in Ontario, New Mexico, Utah, Virginia, <a class="slink" href="mAU.htm">Australia</a>, and in other places.
