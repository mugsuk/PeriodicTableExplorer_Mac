            <td>The most important compounds of arsenic are arsenic (III) oxide, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ('white arsenic'), the yellow sulfide orpiment (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>) and red realgar (As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>), Paris Green, <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> arsenate, and <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead</a> <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> arsenate. The latter three have been used as agricultural insecticides and poisons. Orpiment and realgar were formerly used
               as painting pigments, though they have fallen out of use due to their toxicity and reactivity. Although arsenic is sometimes
               found native in nature, its main economic source is the mineral arsenopyrite mentioned above; it is also found in arsenides
               of metals such as <a class="elink" href="47.htm">silver</a>, <a class="elink" href="27.htm">cobalt</a> (cobaltite: CoAsS and skutterudite: CoAs<sub>3</sub>) and <a class="elink" href="28.htm">nickel</a>, as sulfides, and when oxidised as arsenate minerals such as mimetite, Pb<sub>5</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl and erythrite, Co<sub>3</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> - 8H<sub>2</sub>O, and more rarely arsenites ('arsenite' = arsenate(III), AsO<sub>3</sub><sup>3-</sup> as opposed to arsenate (V), AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>). In addition to the inorganic forms mentioned above, arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment. Inorganic
               arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the food chain, are progressively metabolised to a less toxic form of arsenic through
               a process of methylation.
