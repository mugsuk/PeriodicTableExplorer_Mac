Pure silicon crystals are only occasionally found in nature; they can be found as inclusions with <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a> and in volcanic exhalations. Silicon is usually found in the form of silicon dioxide (also known as silica), and silicate.

               opal are some of the forms in which silicon dioxide appears. (They are known as "lithogenic", as opposed to "biogenic", silicas.)

               and sandstone. Asbestos, feldspar, clay, hornblende, and mica are a few of the many silicate minerals.
