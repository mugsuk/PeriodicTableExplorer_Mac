            <td>In terms of supply, the Sudbury region of Ontario, <a class="slink" href="mCA.htm">Canada</a>, produces about 30 percent of the world's supply of nickel. The Sudbury Basin deposit is theorized to have been created by
               a massive meteorite impact event early in the geologic history of Earth. <a class="slink" href="mRU.htm">Russia</a> contains about 40% of the world's known resources at the massive Norilsk deposit in Siberia. The Russian mining company MMC
               Norilsk Nickel mines this for the world market, as well as the associated palladium. Other major deposits of nickel are found
               in New Caledonia, <a class="slink" href="mAU.htm">Australia</a>, <a class="slink" href="mCU.htm">Cuba</a>, and <a class="slink" href="mID.htm">Indonesia</a>. The deposits in tropical areas are typically laterites which are produced by the intense weathering of ultramafic igneous
               rocks and the resulting secondary concentration of nickel bearing oxide and silicate minerals. A recent development has been
               the exploitation of a deposit in western <a class="slink" href="mTR.htm">Turkey</a>, especially convenient for European smelters, steelmakers and factories. The one locality in the <a class="slink" href="mUS.htm">United States</a> where nickel is commercially mined is Riddle, Oregon, where several square miles of nickel-bearing garnierite surface deposits
               are located.
