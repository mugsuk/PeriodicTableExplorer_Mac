               in large easily mined deposits. Typical ore grades in open-pit mines are 1-5 g/1000 kg (1-5 ppm), ore grades in underground
               or hard rock mines are usually at least 3 g/1000 kg (3 ppm) on average. Since ore grades of 30g/1000kg (30 ppm) are usually
               needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, in most gold mines the gold is invisible.

            <td>Since the 1880s, <a class="slink" href="mZA.htm">South Africa</a> has been the source for a large proportion of the world's gold supply. Production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world
               supply, producing about 1,000 tonnes. However, production in 2005 was just 294 tonnes according to the British Geological
               Survey. This sharp decline was due to the increasing difficulty of extraction and changing economic factors affecting the
               industry in South Africa.

               people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water, but so far they have all been either mistaken
               or crooks. Reverend Prescott Jernegan ran a gold-from seawater swindle in America in the 1890s. A British fraud ran the same
               scam in <a class="slink" href="mGB.htm">England</a> in the early 1900s.

               to help pay <a class="slink" href="mDE.htm">Germany's</a> reparations following the First World War. Unfortunately, his assessment of the concentration of gold in sea water was unduly
               high, probably due to sample contamination. The effort produced little gold and cost the German government far more than the
               commercial value of the gold recovered. No commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has
               yet been identified. Gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future.

               of 2001, it was estimated that all the gold ever mined totalled 145,000 tonnes.
