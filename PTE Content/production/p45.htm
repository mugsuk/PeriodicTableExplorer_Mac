            <td>The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex as the metal occurs in ores mixed with other metals such as <a class="elink" href="46.htm">palladium</a>, <a class="elink" href="47.htm">silver</a>, <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a>, and <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a>. It is found in <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a> ores and obtained free as a white inert metal which it is very difficult to fuse. Principal sources of this element are located
               in <a class="slink" href="mZA.htm">South Africa</a>, in river sands of the Ural Mountains, in North and South America and also in the <a class="elink" href="29.htm">copper</a>-<a class="elink" href="28.htm">nickel</a> sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of <a class="elink" href="28.htm">nickel</a> ore processed makes rhodium recovery cost effective. The main exporter of rhodium is <a class="slink" href="mZA.htm">South Africa</a> (80%+) followed by <a class="slink" href="mRU.htm">Russia</a>. The annual world production of this element is only about 20 tons and there are very few rhodium minerals. It is generally
               difficult to determine if a rock sample contains <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a> group elements. As of 2006, rhodium cost approximately six times as much as <a class="elink" href="79.htm">gold</a>, by weight. Rhodium typical historical price is about about $1,000/troy oz. but in recent years it increased to about $6,000/oz.

So as a typical used fuel is 3% fission products by weight it will contain about 400 grams of rhodium per ton of used
               fuel. The longest lived radioisotope of rhodium is <sup>102m</sup>Rh which has a <a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half life</a> of 2.9 years, while the ground state (<sup>102</sup>Rh)has a half life of 207 days.

            <td>Each kilo of fission rhodium will contain 6.62 ng of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 3.68 ng of <sup>102m</sup>Rh. As <sup>102</sup>Rh decays by beta decay to either <sup>102</sup>Ru (80%) (some <a class="glink" href="gpositron.htm">positron</a> emission will occur) or <sup>102</sup>Pd (20%) (some <a class="glink" href="ggr.htm">gamma ray</a> photons with about 500 keV are generated) and the excited state decays by beta decay (electron capture) to <sup>102</sup>Ru (some <a class="glink" href="ggr.htm">gamma ray</a> photons with about 1 MeV are generated). If the fission occurs in an instant then 13.3 grams of rhodium will contain 67.1
               MBq (1.81 mCi) of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 10.8 MBq (291 uCi) of <sup>102m</sup>Rh. As it is normal to allow used nuclear fuel to stand for about five years before reprocessing, much of this activity will
               decay away leaving 4.7 MBq of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 5.0 MBq of <sup>102m</sup>Rh. If the rhodium metal was then left for 20 years after fission then the 13.3 grams of rhodium metal would contain 1.3 kBq
               of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 500 kBq of <sup>102</sup>mRh. At first glance the rhodium might be adding to the resource value of reprocessed fission waste, but the cost of the separation
               of the rhodium from the other metals needs to be considered.
