            <td>An alkali metal, caesium occurs in lepidolite, pollucite (hydrated silicate of <a class="elink" href="13.htm">aluminium</a> and caesium) and within other sources. One of the world's most significant and rich sources of this metal is at Bernic Lake
               in Manitoba. The deposits there are estimated to contain 300,000 metric tons of pollucite at an average of 20% caesium.

               caesium can be made by the thermal decomposition of caesium azide. The primary compounds of caesium are caesium <a class="elink" href="17.htm">chloride</a> and its <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrate</a>. The price of caesium metal in 1997 was about $US 30 per gram, but its compounds are much cheaper.
