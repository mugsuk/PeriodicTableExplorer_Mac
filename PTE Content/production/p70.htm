            <td>Ytterbium is found with other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a> elements in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand (0.03% ytterbium). The element
               is also found in euxenite and xenotime. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a> but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the late 20th century have simplified separation. Known compounds
               of ytterbium are rare-they haven't been well characterized yet.
