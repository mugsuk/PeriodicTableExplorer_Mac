               about 1.9 kg of ruthenium. The <sup>103</sup>Ru and 106Ru will render the fission ruthenium very radioactive. If the fission occurs in an instant then the ruthenium thus
               formed will have an activity due to <sup>103</sup>Ru of 109 TBq g-1 and <sup>106</sup>Ru of 1.52 TBq g-1.
