            <td>Europium is never found in nature as a free element; however, there are many minerals containing europium, with the most important
               sources being bastnasite and monazite. Europium has also been identified in the spectra of the sun and certain stars. Depletion
               or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earth</a> elements is known as the europium anomaly.

            <td>Divalent europium in small amounts happens to be the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral
               fluorite (<a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> difluoride). The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale, and adjacent parts of northern <a class="slink" href="mGB.htm">England</a>, and indeed it was this fluorite that gave its name to the phenomenon of fluorescence, although it was not until much later
               that europium was discovered or determined to be the cause.
