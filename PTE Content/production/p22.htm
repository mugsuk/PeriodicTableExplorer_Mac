            <td>Titanium is always bonded to other elements in nature. It is the ninth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust (0.63% by
               mass) and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present in most igneous rocks and in sediments derived from them (as well
               as in living things and natural bodies of water). In fact, of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States
               Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.

            <td>It is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the minerals anatase, brookite, ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>), perovskite, rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>), titanite ( CaTiSiO<sub>5</sub>) (sphene), as well in many <a class="slink" href="m26.htm">iron</a> ores. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have any economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high
               concentrations. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western <a class="slink" href="mAU.htm">Australia</a>, <a class="slink" href="mCA.htm">Canada</a>, <a class="slink" href="mNZ.htm">New Zealand</a>, <a class="slink" href="mNO.htm">Norway</a>, and <a class="slink" href="mUA.htm">Ukraine</a>. Large quantities of rutile are also mined in North America and <a class="slink" href="mZA.htm">South Africa</a> and help contribute to the annual production of 90,000 tonnes of the metal and 4.3 million tonnes of titanium dioxide. Total
               known reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.
