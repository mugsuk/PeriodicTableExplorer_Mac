            <td>Terbium is never found in nature as the free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite (Ce<sub>9</sub>Fe(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(SiO<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>4</sub>), gadolinite ((Ce,La,Nd,Y)<sub>2</sub>FeBe<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub>), monazite ((Ce,LaTh,Nd,Y)PO<sub>4</sub>, which contains up to 0.03% of terbium), xenotime (YPO<sub>4</sub>) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Er,La,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, which contains 1% or more of terbium). The richest current commercial sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption clays of
               southern <a class="slink" href="mCN.htm">China</a>. The high-<a class="elink" href="39.htm">yttrium</a> concentrate versions of these are about two-thirds yttrium oxide by weight, and about 1% terbia. However, small amounts occur
               in bastnaesite and monazite, and when these are processed by solvent-extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanoids
               in the form of "samarium-europioum-gadolinium concentrate" (SEG conccentrate), the terbium content of the ore ends up therein.
               Due to the large volumes of bastnaesite processed, relative to the richer ion-adsorption clays, a significant proportion of
               the world's terbium supply comes from bastnaesite.
