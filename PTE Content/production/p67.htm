            <td>Like all other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a>, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It does occur combined with other elements in the minerals gadolinite,
               monazite, and in other rare-earth minerals. It is commercially extracted via ion-exchange from monazite sand (0.05% holmium)
               but is still difficult to separate from other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a>. The element has been isolated through the reduction of its anhydrous <a class="elink" href="17.htm">chloride</a> or <a class="elink" href="9.htm">fluoride</a> with metallic <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a>. Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3 milligrams per kilogram. Holmium obeys the Oddo-Harkins rule: as an
               odd-numbered element, it is less abundant than its immediate even numbered neighbors, dysprosium and <a class="elink" href="68.htm">erbium</a>. However, it is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavy lanthanoids. The principal current source are some of the ion-adsorption
               clays of southern <a class="slink" href="mCN.htm">China</a>. Some of these have a <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a> composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite. <a class="elink" href="39.htm">Yttrium</a> makes up about two-thirds of the total by weight; holmium is around 1.5%. The original ores themselves are very lean, maybe
               only 0.1% total lanthanoid, but are easily extracted.
