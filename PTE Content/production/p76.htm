               <a class="glink" href="galloy.htm">alloy</a> of <a class="elink" href="77.htm">iridium</a> and osmium, and in <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a>-bearing river sands in the Ural Mountains, and North and South America. It also occurs in nickel-bearing ores found in the
               Sudbury, Ontario region with other <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a> group metals. Even though the quantity of <a class="elink" href="78.htm">platinum</a> metals found in these ores is small, the large volume of <a class="elink" href="28.htm">nickel</a> ores processed makes commercial recovery possible.
