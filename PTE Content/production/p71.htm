               to prepare (thus it is one of the most rare and expensive of the <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earth</a> metals). It is separated from other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a> elements by <a class="glink" href="gion.htm">ion</a> exchange and then obtained in the elemental form by reduction of anhydrous LuCl<sub>3</sub> or LuF<sub>3</sub> by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.
