            <td>On Earth, lithium is widely distributed, but because of its reactivity does not occur in its free form. In keeping with the
               origin of its name, lithium forms a minor part of almost all igneous rocks and is also found in many natural brines. Lithium
               is the thirty-first most abundant element, contained particularly in the minerals spodumene (LiAl(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), lepidolite ((KLi<sub>2</sub>Al(Al,Si)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(F,OH)<sub>2</sub>), petalite (LiAlSi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>), and amblygonite ((Li,Na)AlPO<sub>4</sub>(F,OH)). On average, Earth's crust contains 65 parts per million (ppm) lithium.
