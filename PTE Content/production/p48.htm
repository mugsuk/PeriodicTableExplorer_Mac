            <td>Cadmium-containing ores are rare and when found they occur in small quantities. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral
               of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). Consequently, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct
               from mining, smelting, and refining sulfide ores of <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a>, and to a lesser degree, <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead</a> and <a class="elink" href="29.htm">copper</a>. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling
               <a class="elink" href="26.htm">iron</a> and steel scrap. Production in the <a class="slink" href="mUS.htm">United States</a> began in 1907 but it was not until after World War I that cadmium came into wide use.

            <td>A role of cadmium in biology has been recently discovered. A cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine
               diatoms. Cadmium does the same job as zinc in other anhydrases, but the diatoms live in environments with very low zinc concentrations,
               thus biology has taken cadmium rather than <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a>, and made it work. The discovery was made using x-ray absorption fluoresence spectroscopy (XAFS), and cadmium was characterised
               by noting the energy of the x-rays which were absorbed.

            <td>Cadmium is a common impurity in <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a>, and it is most often isolated during the production of <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a>. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted in the presence of <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxygen</a> converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with <a class="elink" href="6.htm">carbon</a> or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted,
               or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution.
