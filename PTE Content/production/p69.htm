            <td>The element is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a>. It is principally extracted from monazite (~0.007% thulium) ores found in river sands through ion-exchange. Newer ion-exchange
               and solvent extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earths</a>, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal source today are the ion adsorption clays of southern
               <a class="slink" href="mCN.htm">China</a>. In the versions of these, where about two-thirds of the total <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earth</a> content is <a class="elink" href="39.htm">yttrium</a>, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with <a class="elink" href="71.htm">lutetium</a> for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its <a class="elink" href="8.htm">oxide</a> with <a class="elink" href="57.htm">lanthanum</a> metal or by <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's compounds are commercially important.
