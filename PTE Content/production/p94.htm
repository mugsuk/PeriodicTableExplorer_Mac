This is also the process used to manufacture <sup>239</sup>Pu in nuclear reactors. Some traces of <sup>244</sup>Pu remain from the birth of the solar system from the waste of supernovae, because its <a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a> of 80 million years is fairly long.

Uranium-238 is present in quantity in most reactor fuel; hence plutonium-239 is continuously made in
               these reactors. Since plutonium-239 can itself be split by neutrons to release energy, plutonium-239 provides a portion of
               the energy generation in a nuclear reactor.

            <td>There are small amounts of Pu-238 in the plutonium of usual plutonium-producing reactors. However, isotopic separation would
               be quite expensive compared to another method: when a U-235 <a class="glink" href="gatom.htm">atom</a> captures a <a class="glink" href="gneutron.htm">neutron</a>, it is converted to an excited state of U-236. Some of the excited U-236 <a class="glink" href="gnucleus.htm">nuclei</a> undergo fission, but some decay to the ground state of U-236 by emitting <a class="glink" href="ggr.htm">gamma radiation</a>. Further neutron capture creates U-237 which has a <a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a> of 7 days and thus quickly decays to Np-237. Since nearly all <a class="elink" href="93.htm">neptunium</a> is produced in this way or consists of <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotopes</a> which decay quickly, one gets nearly pure Np-237 by chemical separation of neptunium. After this chemical separation, Np-237
               is again irradiated by reactor neutrons to be converted to Np-238 which decays to Pu-238 with a <a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a> of 2 days.
