            <td>Vanadium is never found unbound in nature but it does occur in about 65 different minerals among which are patronite VS<sub>4</sub>, vanadinite Pb<sub>5</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl, and carnotite K<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> - 3H<sub>2</sub>O. Vanadium is also present in bauxite, and in <a class="elink" href="6.htm">carbon</a> containing deposits such as crude oil, coal, oil shale and tar sands. Vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in
               light from the Sun and some other stars.

               are not really indicative of available supply.
