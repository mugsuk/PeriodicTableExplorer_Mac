               The amount of artificially produced technetium in the environment exceeds its natural occurrence to a large extent. This is
               due to release by atmospheric nuclear testing along with the disposal and processing of high-level radioactive waste. Due
               to its high fission yield and relatively high <a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half-life</a>, technetium-99 is one of the main components of nuclear waste. Its decay, measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel,
               is dominant at about 104 to 106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste.

               is by the Sellafield plant, which released an estimated 550 TBq (about 900 kg) from 1995-1999 into the Irish Sea. From 2000

            <td>The long half-life of technetium-99 and its ability to form an anionic species makes it (along with 129I) a major concern
               when considering long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste. In addition, many of the processes designed to remove
               fission products from medium-active process streams in reprocessing plants are designed to remove cationic species like <a class="elink" href="55.htm">caesium</a> (e.g., <sup>137</sup>Cs) and <a class="elink" href="38.htm">strontium</a> (e.g., <sup>90</sup>Sr). Hence the pertechnetate is able to escape through these treatment processes. Current disposal options favor burial in
               geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such a course is that the waste is likely to come into contact with water,
               which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and <a class="elink" href="53.htm">iodide</a> are less able to absorb onto the surfaces of minerals so they are likely to be more mobile.

               of research. An alternative disposal method, transmutation, has been demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. This transmutation
               process is one in which the technetium (<sup>99</sup>Tc as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the shortlived <sup>100</sup>Tc (<a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half life</a> = 16 seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium (<sup>100</sup>Ru). One disadvantage of this process is the need for a very pure technetium target, while small traces of other fission products
               are likely to slightly increase the activity of the irradated target if small traces of the minor actinoids (such as <a class="elink" href="95.htm">americium</a> and <a class="elink" href="96.htm">curium</a>) are present in the target then they are likely to undergo fission to form fission products. In this way, a small activity
               and amount of minor actinoids leads to a very high level of radioactivity in the irradated target. The formation of <sup>106</sup>Ru (<a class="glink" href="ghl.htm">half life</a> 374 days) from the fresh fission is likely to increase the activity of the final <a class="elink" href="44.htm">ruthenium</a> metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.

               the technetium from the solution by using a technetium-99m generator ("technetium cow," also occasionally called a molybdenum
