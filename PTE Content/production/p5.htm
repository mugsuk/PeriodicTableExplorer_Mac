            <td><a class="slink" href="mTR.htm">Turkey</a> and the <a class="slink" href="mUS.htm">United States</a> are the world's largest producers of boron. <a class="slink" href="mTR.htm">Turkey</a> has almost 63% of the world's boron potential and boron reserves. Boron does not appear in nature in elemental form but is
               found combined in borax, boric acid, colemanite, kernite, ulexite and borates. Boric acid is sometimes found in volcanic spring
               waters. Ulexite is a borate mineral that naturally has properties of fiber optics.

               Desert of California, with borax being the most important source there. The largest borax deposits are found in Central and
               Western <a class="slink" href="mTR.htm">Turkey</a> including the provinces of Eskisehir, Kutahya and Balikesir.

            <td>Pure elemental boron is not easy to prepare. The earliest methods used involve reduction of boric oxide with metals such as
               <a class="elink" href="12.htm">magnesium</a> or <a class="elink" href="13.htm">aluminium</a>. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal borides. (The reaction is quite spectacular though). Pure boron
               can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halogenides with <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> at high temperatures. The highly pure boron, for the use in semiconductor industry, is produced by the decomposition of diborane
               at high temperatures and then further purified with the Czochralski process.
