            <td>Hafnium is estimated to make up about 0.00058% of the Earth's upper crust by weight. It is found combined in natural zirconium
               compounds but it does not exist as a free element in nature. Minerals that contain zirconium, such as alvite [(Hf, Th, Zr)SiO<sub>4</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O], thortveitite and zircon (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>), usually contain between 1 and 5% hafnium. Hafnium and zirconium have nearly identical chemistry, which makes the two difficult
               to separate. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of <a class="elink" href="40.htm">zirconium</a> refinement. This is done through reducing hafnium(IV) chloride with <a class="elink" href="12.htm">magnesium</a> or <a class="elink" href="11.htm">sodium</a> in the Kroll process.
