            <td>Helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe after <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> and constitutes 23% of the elemental mass of the universe. It is concentrated in stars, where it is formed from <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a> by the nuclear fusion of the proton-proton chain reaction and CNO cycle. According to the Big Bang model of the early development
               of the universe, the vast majority of helium was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, from one to three minutes after the
               Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models.

            <td>In the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million, largely because most helium
               in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space due to its inertness and low mass. In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of the
               upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.

The decay product is primarily found in minerals of <a class="elink" href="92.htm">uranium</a> and <a class="elink" href="90.htm">thorium</a>, including cleveites, pitchblende, carnotite, monazite and beryl, because they emit alpha particles, which consist of helium

               crust. In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4
               parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric <a class="elink" href="26.htm">iron</a>. The greatest concentrations on the planet are in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is derived.

            <td>For large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which contains up to 7% helium. Since
               helium has a lower <a class="glink" href="gbp.htm">boiling point</a> than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a> and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which almost
               all of the remaining <a class="elink" href="7.htm">nitrogen</a> and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually
               resulting in 99.995% pure, Grade-A, helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is <a class="elink" href="10.htm">neon</a>.
