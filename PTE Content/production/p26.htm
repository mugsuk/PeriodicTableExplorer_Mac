            <td>Iron is one of the most common elements on Earth, making up about 5% of the Earth's crust. Most of this iron is found in various
               iron oxides, such as the minerals hematite, magnetite, and taconite. The Earth's core is believed to consist largely of a
               metallic iron-<a class="elink" href="28.htm">nickel</a> <a class="glink" href="galloy.htm">alloy</a>. About 5% of the meteorites similarly consist of iron-<a class="elink" href="28.htm">nickel</a> <a class="glink" href="galloy.htm">alloy</a>. Although rare, these are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.
