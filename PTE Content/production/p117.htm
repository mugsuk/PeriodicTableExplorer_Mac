            <td>The experiment to produce element 117 began on July 28, 2009. In January 2010, scientists at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear
               Reactions (in Russia) announced internally that they had detected the decay of a new element with atomic number 117 via two
               decay chains: one of an odd-odd <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotope</a> undergoing 6 alpha decays before spontaneous fission, and one of an odd-even <a class="glink" href="gisotope.htm">isotope</a> undergoing 3 alpha decays before fission. The obtained data from the experiment was sent to the Lawrence Livermore National
               Laboratory (in Livermore, California) for further analysis. On April 9, 2010, an official report was released in the journal
               Physical Review Letters identifying the isotopes as <sup>294</sup>Ts and <sup>293</sup>Ts, which were shown to have half-lives on the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds.
