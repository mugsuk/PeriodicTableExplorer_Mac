            <td>Strontium commonly occurs in nature, the 15th most abundant element on earth, averaging 0.034% of all igneous rock and is
               found chiefly as the form of the sulfate mineral celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO<sub>3</sub>). Of the two, celestite occurs much more frequently in sedimentary deposits of sufficient size to make development of mining
               facilities attractive. Strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals because strontium is used most often
               in the carbonate form, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development. The metal can be prepared
               by electrolysis of melted strontium chloride mixed with <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a> chloride:
