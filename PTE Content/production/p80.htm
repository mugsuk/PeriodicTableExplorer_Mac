               per million. However, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that comprise the majority of the crustal
               mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury
               ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times
               average crustal abundance).

               to the crust of the Earth, often in hot springs or other volcanic regions.

               in the production of silver in colonial Spanish America.
