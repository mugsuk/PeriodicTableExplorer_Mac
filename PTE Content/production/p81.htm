               in association with <a class="elink" href="19.htm">potassium</a> minerals in clays, soils, and granites, it is not generally considered to be commercially recoverable from those forms. The
               major source of commercial thallium is the trace amounts found in <a class="elink" href="29.htm">copper</a>, <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead</a>, <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a>, and other <a class="elink" href="16.htm">sulfide</a> ores.

            <td>Thallium is found in the minerals crookesite TlCu<sub>7</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, hutchinsonite TlPbAs<sub>5</sub>S<sub>9</sub>, and lorandite TlAsS<sub>2</sub>. It also occurs as trace in pyrites and extracted as a by-product of roasting this ore for sulfuric acid production. The
               metal can be obtained from the smelting of <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead</a> and <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a> rich ores. <a class="elink" href="25.htm">Manganese</a> nodules found on the ocean floor also contain thallium but nodule extraction is prohibitively expensive and potentially environmentally
               destructive. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as sulfide or selenide
               complexes with <a class="elink" href="51.htm">antimony</a>, <a class="elink" href="33.htm">arsenic</a>, <a class="elink" href="29.htm">copper</a>, <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead</a>, and <a class="elink" href="47.htm">silver</a> but are rare and have no commercial importance as sources of this element.
