            <td>Aluminium is a reactive metal that is difficult to extract from ore, aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Direct reduction - with <a class="elink" href="6.htm">carbon</a>, for example - is not economically viable since aluminium oxide has a melting point of about 2,000&deg;C. It is extracted by
               electrolysis; the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite and then reduced to the pure metal. By this process, the
               operational temperature of the reduction cells is around 950 to 980&deg;C. Cryolite is found as a mineral in Greenland, but in
               industrial use it has been replaced by a synthetic substance. Cryolite is a mixture of aluminium, <a class="elink" href="11.htm">sodium</a>, and <a class="elink" href="20.htm">calcium</a> fluorides: (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining bauxite in the Bayer process.

               12.8 kWh/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). Reduction line current for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kA. State-of-the-art smelters
