            <td>Zirconium is never found in nature as a free metal. The principal economic source of zirconium is the zirconium silicate mineral,
               zircon (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>), which is found in deposits located in <a class="slink" href="mAU.htm">Australia</a>, <a class="slink" href="mZA.htm">South Africa</a> and the <a class="slink" href="mUS.htm">United States</a>, reports the British Geological Survey. (It is extracted as a dark sooty powder, or as a gray metallic crystalline substance).
               Zirconium and <a class="elink" href="72.htm">hafnium</a> are contained in zircon at a ratio of about 50 to 1 and are difficult to separate. Zircon is a coproduct or byproduct of
               the mining and processing of heavy-mineral sands for the <a class="elink" href="22.htm">titanium</a> minerals, ilmenite and rutile, or <a class="elink" href="50.htm">tin</a> minerals. Zirconium is also in 30 other recognized mineral species including baddeleyite. This metal is commercially produced
               by reduction of the Zirconium(IV) chloride with <a class="elink" href="12.htm">magnesium</a> in the Kroll process, and through other methods. Commercial-quality zirconium still has a content of 1 to 3% hafnium.
