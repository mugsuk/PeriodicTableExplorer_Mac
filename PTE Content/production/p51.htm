            <td>Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 mineral species. Antimony is sometimes found native, but
               more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>) which is the predominant ore mineral. Commercial forms of antimony are generally ingots, broken pieces, granules, and cast
               cake. Other forms are powder, shot, and single crystals.
