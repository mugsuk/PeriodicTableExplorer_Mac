            <td>In nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria,
               green algae and plants. Algae produce about 73 to 87 percent of the net global production of oxygen, which makes it available
               to humans and other animals for respiration. Another major source of oxygen is trees. Trees can absorb carbon dioxide at the
               rate of 26 pounds per year - especially young trees that are still growing - while releasing oxygen into the air.

            <td>In the laboratory and industrially, oxygen can be produced through electrolysis of water into oxygen and <a class="elink" href="1.htm">hydrogen</a>. A similar method is the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well,
               such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life support equipment on spacecraft
               and submarines.
