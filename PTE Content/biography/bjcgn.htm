            <td class="JF">Marignac, who was born in Geneva, Switzerland, was educated in Paris at the Ecole Polytechnique and the School of Mines. He
               worked in Justus von Liebig's laboratory in Giessen for a year and at the Sevres porcelain factory before his appointment
               to the chair of chemistry at Geneva (1841). He also became professor of mineralogy in 1845 and held the two posts until his
               retirement in 1878.
