            <td class="JF">Tennant was born in Selby in Yorkshire. He began to study medicine at Edinburgh in 1781, but in a few months moved to Cambridge,
               where he devoted himself to botany and chemistry. He graduated M.D. at Cambridge in 1790, and about the same time purchased
               an estate near Cheddar, where he carried out agricultural experiments. He was appointed professor of chemistry at Cambridge
               in 1813, but lived to deliver only one course of lectures, being killed near Boulogne-sur-Mer by the fall of a bridge over
               which he was riding.
