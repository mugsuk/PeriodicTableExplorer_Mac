            <td class="JF">He was born in Dachau (Bavaria) in 1931. He studied physics at the Technical University of Stuttgart and Munchen, and obtained
               his Ph.D. in 1961 under H. Maier-Leibniz, Technical University Munchen. His major research fields were fission, interaction
               of heavy <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\ion.htm">ions</a> in matter and atomic physics with fission product beams at the Research Center of Julich (1965 - 1970).

            <td class="JF">From 1989 - 1992 he was research Director of the European Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL), Grenoble. He was Senior Scientist
               at the <a class="blink" href="hirl.htm">Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Schwerionenforschung Darmstadt</a>, GSI, from 1971 - 1996. He developed recoil separators equipped with new detector systems during most of his scientific career.
               His main research activities were: synthesis and production of new elements and <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\isotope.htm">isotopes</a>, studies of reaction mechanisms, studies of characteristic <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\xr.htm">X-rays</a> produced in ion-atom collisions - among others X-ray emission from transient superheavy collision systems, studies on track
               formation of heavy ions in solids by <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\neutron.htm">neutron</a> and <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\xr.htm">X-ray</a> small angle scattering. He also directed experiments on <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\isotope.htm">isotope</a> production in fission by relativistic reactions of <sup>238</sup>U. Since 1996 he is involved in a project on incineration of nuclear waste by spallation and fission reactions.
