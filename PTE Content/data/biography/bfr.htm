            <td class="JF">Reich, who was born at Bernburg in Germany, studied at the University of Gottingen and taught at the Freiberg Mining Academy. In 1863 he obtained a yellow precipitate
               from some local <a class="elink" href="30.htm">zinc</a> ores. Convinced that it contained a new element he asked his assistant Hieronymus Richter to examine it spectroscopically
               (he himself was colour blind). Richter found a new line in the dark blue region that confirmed Reich's original conviction;
               the new element was named '<a class="elink" href="49.htm">indium</a>' after the bright indigo line characteristic of its spectrum.
