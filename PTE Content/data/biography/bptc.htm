               in 1868 and was later made professor of general and agricultural chemistry there. He is mainly remembered for his work on
               the <a class="glink" href="gree.htm">rare earth elements</a>.

            <td class="JF">In 1874 Cleve concluded that didymium was in fact two <a class="glink" href="gelement.htm">elements</a>; this was proved in 1885 and the two elements named <a class="elink" href="60.htm">neodymium</a> and <a class="elink" href="59.htm">praseodymium</a>. In 1879 he showed that the element <a class="elink" href="21.htm">scandium</a>, newly discovered by the Swedish chemist <a class="blink" href="bln.htm">Lars Nilson</a> (1840-1899), was in fact the eka-boron predicted by <a class="blink" href="bdim.htm">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> in his <a class="glink" href="gpt.htm">periodic table</a>. In the same year, working with a sample of erbia from which he had removed all traces of scandia and ytterbia, Cleve found
               two new earths, which he named <a class="elink" href="67.htm">holmium</a>, after Stockholm, and <a class="elink" href="69.htm">thulium</a>, after the old name for Scandinavia. <a class="elink" href="67.htm">holmium</a> in fact turned out to be a mixture for, in 1886, <a class="blink" href="bpelb.htm">Lecoq de Boisbaudran</a> discovered that it also contained the new element <a class="elink" href="66.htm">dysprosium</a>.
