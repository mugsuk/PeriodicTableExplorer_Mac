# PeriodicTableExplorer_Mac
Periodic Table Explorer (Mac version) - 2022 update

Forked from MaximumOctopus https://github.com/MaximumOctopus/PeriodicTableExplorer_Mac

**IMPORTANT:**
There are 3 .ccs files in which I have chaned the font from 'Verdana' to 'SFProRounded-Regular'
the files are:  
**element.css  
index.css  
paf.css**  

Open each of those files in the text editor of your choice and change the font to whatever is to your liking if the build is failing because you do not have the font 'SFProRounded-Regular' on your system

Feel free to mail me if you are having any issues
